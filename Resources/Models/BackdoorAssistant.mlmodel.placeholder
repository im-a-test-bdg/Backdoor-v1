# Core ML Model Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual Core ML model that would be included in the production build.

The actual model file should be a properly trained Core ML model with:

- Input features:
  - "userInput" (String): The processed user message
  - "appContext" (String): Encoded app context information
  - "conversationHistory" (String): Recent conversation history

- Output features:
  - "response" (String): The AI assistant's response

This model should be trained using Create ML or other Core ML compatible tools, and should be designed 
for on-device learning to improve over time based on user interactions.

# Model Training Recommendations

When creating the actual Core ML model for production:

1. Use a combination of NLP models from Create ML (Text Classifier, Word Tagger) as base
2. Train on a corpus of Backdoor-specific conversations
3. Include domain-specific knowledge about app signing, certificates, sources
4. Enable updatable model configuration for on-device learning
5. Keep the model size reasonable (<50MB) for efficient loading and prediction

# Model Security

The production model should be signed and include integrity checks to prevent unauthorized 
modification or replacement. The CoreMLModelSecurity class implements these protections.
